# Implementation of a privacy preserving KNN algorithm based on FHE
This repository contains the code developed during my Final Degree Project.

# Content
This repository is structured in three folders
-Charts/: It contains two notebooks: 
    -- chart_compositions.ipynb: Notebook used to understand the comparison algorithms 
    -- chart_results.ipynb: Notebook used to create the plots for analyzing the time complexity of the KNN algorithm



-Data/: It contains three files:
    --heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv: Dataset containing all the original 299 samples
    --heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset_16samples.csv: Dataset containing 16 samples, used to compare the memory size between unencrypted data and encrypted data
